##MODULE_NAME_1     [note: no spaces allowed]
#place your code for this module here.

#make sure you put a semi-colon at the end of each line
#make sure to comment your code

##MODULE_NAME_2

#end a library with the following line

Further notes:

* Do not make libraries executable. This presents a security issue and is completly unnecissary due to the code being ran inside a variable
* If you need to make a funtion inside a module, go ahead and try making that function into a module too, just for future use
* the file name is the library name. So, if the file name is "stupid_bash_lib" then the library name is "stupid_bash_lib".
* if you wish to add more info or documentation, feel free. Just don't forget to comment it out.
* if you wish to clearsign a library for copyright reasons, feel free to do so. Just make sure that the library is re-clearsigned with each update
