Bash Library handler. This program will import libraries written in BASH (MAYBE other scripting langauges), written for BASH, and allow a programmer to use them in any program.

Most of this will be written in BASH for simplicity's sake, but do not expect all of it to be like that. There very well may be parts in Python, C++, C, or some other language.
